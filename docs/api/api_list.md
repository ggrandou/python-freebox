##### Incoming port configuration

Some services hosted on the Freebox Server need to listen to public ip address port.
Incoming port api allow to enable/disable incoming port binding, and select the bind port to
prevent conflit with your own nat port forwarding rules.

NOTE: you can’t add or remove incoming ports, this ports are managed by Freebox services.

NOTE: in case of conflict with a nat port forwarding rule, this rule will have a higher priority and
override the port forwarding rule.

stored under shared_bss_params

if not the bss will use a configuration specific to this bss
stored under bss_params

when you want to edit the bss config you should change the config
values using values from bss_params or shared_bss_params as a source
and update use_shared_params accordingly.

###### Diagnostic API

This API is intended to simplify detecting problems or suboptimal configs on
bsss or aps. This API is articulated around the WifiDiagItem

**`WifiDiagItem`**

: **`ap_id` int**

: When this item relates to an AP, this indicates the AP’s index
When this item relates to a BSS, this field is unset

**`bssid` str**

: When this item relates to a BSS, this field indicates the bss’s id
When this item relates to an AP, this field is unset

**`code` enum**

: The code identifying which param is faulty/suboptimal

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| all | This is a the same as doing a full reset of this AP/BSS |
| network_disabled | This changes the ‘enabled’ field in WifiBssConfig |
| network_security | This changes the ‘encryption’ field in WifiBssConfig |
| network_visibility | This changes the ‘hide_ssid’ field in WifiBssConfig |
| channel_width | This changes the ‘channel_width’ field in WifiApConfig |
| channel_value | This changes the ‘channel’ & ‘secondary_channel’ fields in WifiApConfig |

**`severity` enum**

: | Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| minor | minor problems don’t have performance/compatibility implications |
| major | major problems do |

Global diagnostic

###### Wifi guest

This api lets you create “custom key” (guest Wi-Fi access) that can be used
on your existing bss to allow someone to connect to your Wi-Fi network without
knowing your actual Wi-Fi password.

When creating a “custom key” you can select if the associated access should
be restricted to WAN only access, or if the guest can also access your local
network. You can also define how long the access should be available.

A dedicated Wi-Fi network is created for guest usage, and the SSID can
be configured. Note that network will only be running when you have
wifi running and a custom key created.

Wifi Custom Key config

**`WifiCustomKeyConfig`**

###### Temporary disabling Wifi

This API lets you disable some wifi bands for a given amount of time. This is useful to pair IOT devices that only supports some bands.

Temporary disable object

TemporaryWifiDisable has the following attributes:

**`TemporaryWifiDisable`**

###### Multi Link Operation (MLO)

For a given BSS you can configure with which bands it will try to participate in
an MLD. Whatever the configuration is, the operational state may be
different if the BSS on the partner AP is unavailable (disabled or no EHT) or
does not have the right parameters (not using shared params or wrong security)

Available partner

To get the available AP partner of a BSS use the mlo/allowed_comb api to return
a list of possible combinations:

**`GET ``/api/v14/wifi/bss/{id}/mlo/allowed_comb`**

: Get the allowed phy combination for a BSS

**Example request**:

```
GET /api/v14/wifi/bss/02:00:00:00:00:00/mlo/allowed_comb HTTP/1.1
Host: mafreebox.freebox.fr
```

**Example response**:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
```

```

```

**{**
: “success”: true,
“result”: [

[ 0, 1 ],
[ 0 ]

]

}

MLO configuration object

**`WifiMLOConfiguration`**

: **`partners` [int]**

: List of phys participating in the MLD for the BSS
An empty array means MLO is disabled
An array with only the BSS’s AP index in it means SLO (single link mode)
The allowed combinations are retrieved by the mlo/allowed_comb api.

Getting the MLO config

To get the currently configured partners of a BSS mlo/config. It will return the
current WifiMLOConfiguration for this BSS

**`GET ``/api/v14/wifi/bss/{id}/mlo/config`**

: Get the current WifiMLOConfiguration for the BSS

**Example request**:

```
GET /api/v14/wifi/bss/02:00:00:00:00:00/mlo/config HTTP/1.1
Host: mafreebox.freebox.fr
```

**Example response**:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
```

```
{
   "success": true,
   "result": {
      partners: [ 0, 1 ]
   }
}
```

Changing the MLO config

To update the MLO confuguration put a new WifiMLOConfiguration
at mlo/config. Please note that only combinations from mlo/allowed_comb can
be used for the ‘partners’ field

**`PUT ``/api/v9/wifi/config/`**

: Update the WifiGlobalConfig

**Example request**:

```
PUT /api/v14/wifi/bss/02:00:00:00:00:00/mlo/config/ HTTP/1.1

Lan Host object

Lan Host has the following attributes:

**`LanHost`**

: **`id` string* Read-only***

: Host id (unique on this interface)

**`primary_name` string**

: Host primary name (chosen from the list of available names, or
manually set by user)

**`domain_name` string**

: Host domain name on the local network (manually set by user,
or automatically configured during device registration).

The string must respect the following rules:

- Must end with ‘.home’

- 63 characters long at max

- Only alphabetical characters are accepted

- Digits are accepted provided they are not placed at the beginning of the string, nor after another dot character.

- Hyphens and dots are accepted provided they are not placed at the beginning or the end of the string, nor after or before another dot character.

It is also possible to use an empty string. This special value
means no local domain should be registered for this host.

**`host_type` enum**

: When possible, the Freebox will try to guess the host_type, but
you can manually override this to the correct value

##### Incoming port configuration

Some services hosted on the Freebox Server need to listen to public ip address port.
Incoming port api allow to enable/disable incoming port binding, and select the bind port to
prevent conflit with your own nat port forwarding rules.

NOTE: you can’t add or remove incoming ports, this ports are managed by Freebox services.

NOTE: in case of conflict with a nat port forwarding rule, this rule will have a higher priority and
override the port forwarding rule.

###### Wi-Fi BSS

Each AP can manage a set of BSS, with this api you can manage BSS settings

Wi-Fi BSS objects

**`WifiBss`**

: **`id` int* Read-only***

: bss id

**`phy_id` string* Read-only***

: associated AP id

**`status` [WifiBssStatus](index.html#WifiBssStatus)* Read-only***

stored under shared_bss_params

if not the bss will use a configuration specific to this bss
stored under bss_params

when you want to edit the bss config you should change the config
values using values from bss_params or shared_bss_params as a source
and update use_shared_params accordingly.

With this api you can list the surrounding Wi-Fi access points, and Wi-fi channel usage.

This a new feature introduced in firmware 2.1.0 (api v2).

A scan is automatically done at AP startup, if you need to refresh the information you can use the scan api

###### Diagnostic API

This API is intended to simplify detecting problems or suboptimal configs on
bsss or aps. This API is articulated around the WifiDiagItem

**`WifiDiagItem`**

: **`ap_id` int**

: When this item relates to an AP, this indicates the AP’s index
When this item relates to a BSS, this field is unset

**`bssid` str**

: When this item relates to a BSS, this field indicates the bss’s id
When this item relates to an AP, this field is unset

**`code` enum**

: The code identifying which param is faulty/suboptimal

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| all | This is a the same as doing a full reset of this AP/BSS |
| network_disabled | This changes the ‘enabled’ field in WifiBssConfig |
| network_security | This changes the ‘encryption’ field in WifiBssConfig |
| network_visibility | This changes the ‘hide_ssid’ field in WifiBssConfig |
| channel_width | This changes the ‘channel_width’ field in WifiApConfig |
| channel_value | This changes the ‘channel’ & ‘secondary_channel’ fields in WifiApConfig |

**`severity` enum**

: | Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| minor | minor problems don’t have performance/compatibility implications |
| major | major problems do |

Global diagnostic

The global diagnostics evaluates/works on all AP/BSS at once.
This is good for bulk access

**`GET ``/api/v9/wifi/diag`**

: Get the WifiDiagItem for the box

**Example request**:

```

###### Wifi WPS API

This api lets you open wps sessions on wifi a bss to allow a device to connect
to Wifi using WPS

To be able to open wps session, you first need to make sure that the bss is
properly configured (with WifiBssConfig field ‘wps_enabled’ set to true)

Note that wps_enabled requires the encryption to either be wpa2_psk_ccmp
or wpa2_psk_auto

You should call the WifiWpsCandidate api help to check which bss
can be used for wps

Also, only one WPS session can be active at a given time

###### Wifi guest

This api lets you create “custom key” (guest Wi-Fi access) that can be used
on your existing bss to allow someone to connect to your Wi-Fi network without
knowing your actual Wi-Fi password.

When creating a “custom key” you can select if the associated access should
be restricted to WAN only access, or if the guest can also access your local
network. You can also define how long the access should be available.

A dedicated Wi-Fi network is created for guest usage, and the SSID can
be configured. Note that network will only be running when you have
wifi running and a custom key created.

Adding a new Download task

Adding by URL

Supported URL scheme are `http://`, `ftp://`, `magnet:`

You can start a recursive download by setting the recursive parameter.
The downloader will then extract links from each donwloaded html page
and continue downloading files on the same domain and on the same root
path.  This can be used to download all the files on a directory
index.

You can add multiple downloads at once by passing a list of URL
(separated by a new line delimiter) in download_url_list instead of
using download_url.

/!NOTE: for this API the request arguments must be encoded using
“application/x-www-form-urlencoded” (or “multipart/form-data” for file
upload) instead of “application/json”

**`POST ``/api/v8/downloads/add`**

: **Parameters**

: - **download_url** (*string*) – The URL

- **download_url_list** (*string*) – A list of URL separated by a new
line delimiter (use download_url
or download_url_list)

- **download_dir** (*string*) – The download destination directory
(optional: will use the
configuration download_dir by
default)

- **filename** (*string*) – Override the name of the destination file. Only
valid with one, non-recursive download_url.

- **hash** (*string*) – Verify the hash of the downloaded file. The format is
sha256:xxxxxx or sha512:xxxxxx; or the URL of a
SHA256SUMS, SHA512SUMS, -CHECKSUM or .sha256 file.
Only valid with one, non-recursive download_url.

- **recursive** (*bool*) – If true the download will be recursive

- **username** (*string*) – Auth username (optional)

- **password** (*string*) – Auth password (optional)

- **archive_password** (*string*) – The password required to extract
downloaded content (only relevant
for nzb)

- **cookies** (*string*) – The http cookies (to be able to pass
session cookies along with url). This is the content
of the HTTP Cookie header, for example: cookie1=value1;
cookie2=value2

NOTE: instead of passing password and username you can include them in the URL.

**Example request : Single download add**:

```
POST /api/v8/downloads/add HTTP/1.1
Host: mafreebox.freebox.fr

download_url=http%3A%2F%2Fcdimage.debian.org%2Fdebian-cd%2F6.0.6%2Famd64%2Fbt-cd%2Fdebian-6.0.6-amd64-CD-1.iso.torrent

Adding a new Download task

Adding by URL

Supported URL scheme are `http://`, `ftp://`, `magnet:`

You can start a recursive download by setting the recursive parameter.
The downloader will then extract links from each donwloaded html page
and continue downloading files on the same domain and on the same root
path.  This can be used to download all the files on a directory
index.

You can add multiple downloads at once by passing a list of URL
(separated by a new line delimiter) in download_url_list instead of
using download_url.

/!NOTE: for this API the request arguments must be encoded using
“application/x-www-form-urlencoded” (or “multipart/form-data” for file
upload) instead of “application/json”

**`POST ``/api/v8/downloads/add`**

: **Parameters**

: - **download_url** (*string*) – The URL

- **download_url_list** (*string*) – A list of URL separated by a new
line delimiter (use download_url
or download_url_list)

- **download_dir** (*string*) – The download destination directory
(optional: will use the
configuration download_dir by
default)

- **filename** (*string*) – Override the name of the destination file. Only
valid with one, non-recursive download_url.

- **hash** (*string*) – Verify the hash of the downloaded file. The format is
sha256:xxxxxx or sha512:xxxxxx; or the URL of a
SHA256SUMS, SHA512SUMS, -CHECKSUM or .sha256 file.
Only valid with one, non-recursive download_url.

- **recursive** (*bool*) – If true the download will be recursive

- **username** (*string*) – Auth username (optional)

- **password** (*string*) – Auth password (optional)

- **archive_password** (*string*) – The password required to extract
downloaded content (only relevant
for nzb)

- **cookies** (*string*) – The http cookies (to be able to pass
session cookies along with url). This is the content
of the HTTP Cookie header, for example: cookie1=value1;
cookie2=value2

NOTE: instead of passing password and username you can include them in the URL.

**Example request : Single download add**:

```
POST /api/v8/downloads/add HTTP/1.1
Host: mafreebox.freebox.fr

download_url=http%3A%2F%2Fcdimage.debian.org%2Fdebian-cd%2F6.0.6%2Famd64%2Fbt-cd%2Fdebian-6.0.6-amd64-CD-1.iso.torrent
&download_dir=L0Rpc3F1ZSBkdXIvVMOpbMOpY2hhcmdlbWVudHMv
```

**Example response**:

On success you’ll get the id of the new download task.

```

##### Download Pieces

Each Torrent is split in ‘pieces’ of fixed size. The Download Piece Api allow
tracking the download state of each pieces of a Torrent

###### Get the pieces status a given download

The result value is a string, with each character representing a piece status.
Piece status can be:

##### Download Blacklist [UNSTABLE]

For bittorrent downloads, we use a blacklist to store information about “useless” or broken peers.
For instance if a peer is complete and we are trying to seed data, there is no use attempting to connect
to this peer again.

The download blacklist api allow you to retrieve information about this blacklist, and remove, or add peers
to the blacklist.

Each  DownloadBlacklistEntry can be specific to a torrent, or “global” and apply to any torrent.

| connect_fail | failed to connect |
| hs_timeout | handshake timeout |
| hs_failed | handshake failed |
| hs_crypt_failed | handshake failed during crypto |
| hs_crypto_disabled | handshake failed because encryption is disabled |
| torrent_not_found | torrent not found |

#### File System Api

##### File System

With the file system API you can access files on Freebox
internal disk and disks connected to the Freebox.

###### Path encoding

`NOTE:`

For maximum compatibility issues path are encoded in base64, you
*should* use the path as it is returned by the ls API call.

For instance this will solve problems with [unicode equivalence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence) .

Although “Spécial” (0x53 0x70 **0xc3 0xa9** 0x63 0x69 0x61 0x6c) and
“Spécial” (0x53 0x70 **0x65 0xcc 0x81** 0x63 0x69 0x61 0x6c) are utf8
equivalent, it represents two different paths.

Some software/libraries will replace the original string with its
normalized form, causing issues.  The use of base64 encoded path will
ensure the original path will be preserved.

###### File System Errors

When attempting to access the file system API, you may encounter the
following errors:

| error_code | Description |

###### Operations

Each time you want to perform a modification on the file system you
will have to create a new FsTask that you will be
able to monitor.

NOTE: The requested operation may be en-queued to avoid performance
drop because of excessive disk io

Conflict resolution

For certain file operations where a file name conflict can happen,
you must specify a conflict resolution mode.

Valid resolution modes are:

| Conflict mode | Description |
| --- | --- |
| overwrite | Overwrite the destination file |
| both | Keep both files (rename the file adding a suffix) |
| recent | Only overwrite if newer than destination file |
| skip | Keep the destination file |

##### File Upload

This API allows you to upload files to the Freebox Server.

NOTE: for large transfer files, you should prefer FTP over HTTP
transfer

*WARNING* the previous http upload method is now deprecated since api v4,
you must now use the new WebSocket upload Api. If you can’t support WebSocket,
you must use ftp for file transfer

###### File Upload Errors

When attempting to access the file upload API, you may encounter the
following errors:

| error_code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| invalid_request | Invalid request |
| path_not_found | File or folder not found |
| access_denied | Write permission denied in the destination folder |
| destination_conflict | A file with same name already exists |
| invalid_id | Invalid file upload id |
| cancelled | Someone on a side channel as cancelled the upload |
| noent | No upload with this id |

###### File Upload object

File uploads have the following attributes:

**`FileUpload`**

: **`id` int* Read-only***

: upload id

**`size` int* Read-only***

: Upload file size in bytes

**`uploaded` int* Read-only***

: Uploaded bytes

**`status` enum* Read-only***

**`last_update` timestamp* Read-only***

: last update of file upload object

**`upload_name` string* Read-only***

: name of the file uploaded

**`dirname` string* Read-only***

: upload destination directory

###### WebSocket File Upload API

The file upload WebSocket path is /api/v8/ws/upload

With this new API, the need for creating a ‘file upload authorization’
has now been removed.

To be able to upload a file to the Freebox, you must open a WebSocket
connection to the upload api, then for each file you want to upload
you must :

- send a FileUploadStartAction with the action ‘upload_start’

- wait for the associated [WebSocketResponse](index.html#WebSocketResponse) that indicates
success, then start transferring the file content by chunks,
each chunk being a binary WebSocket frame.

For each chunk you send, you’ll get a WsUploadProgress response indicating that
the associated chunk has been received and processed. Note that you should not
wait for this response before sending the next data chunk in order to get
good bandwidth performance.

- once all chunks have been transferred, you should send a
FileUploadFinalizeAction with the action ‘upload_finalize’ and wait
for the associated [WebSocketResponse](index.html#WebSocketResponse) indicating success

Note that if you have multiple files to send, you should reuse the same
WebSocket connection, and repeat the upload steps again.

If for any reason the WebSocket is closed during upload, the partially sent
file will be left as-is on the Freebox to allow resuming upload at a later point.

If you want to cancel an ongoing upload ou can send a
FileUploadCancelAction. The partially uploaded
file will then be deleted

File Upload Start Action

**`FileUploadStartAction`**

: **`request_id` int**

: optional request_id

**`action` string**

: must be ‘upload_start’

**`size` int**

: optional file size

**`dirname` string**

: the destination directory (encoded value)

**`filename` string**

: the destination filename

**`force` enum**

: select the way conflicts are handled

| Force mode | Description |
| --- | --- |
| *missing* | The response to the FileUploadStartAction will be an error with ‘destination_conflict’ if the destination file already exists. The response will also contain a file_size attribute containing the existing file length (useful for resuming upload) |
| overwrite | If the target file already exists it will be overridden |
| resume | The upload will resume, all sent chunks will then be appended to the existing file. |

File Upload Finalize action

**`FileUploadFinalizeAction`**

: **`request_id` int**

: optional request_id

**`action` string**

: must be ‘upload_finalize’

File Upload Cancel action

**`FileUploadCancelAction`**

: **`request_id` int**

: optional request_id

**`action` string**

: must be ‘upload_cancel’

File Upload Chunk

File upload chunk are just Binary WebSocket frames containing raw file
content.

File Upload Chunk Response

For each received chunk, the Freebox will send a chunk response containing
upload progress information the request_id used in response will be
the one from the FileUploadStartAction, and ‘action’ value
will be ‘upload_data’

**`FileUploadChunkResponse`**

: **`total_len` int**

: target file current length

**`complete` bool**

: will be true in a reply to FileUploadFinalizeAction
or FileUploadCancelAction

**`cancelled` bool**

: will be true in a reply FileUploadCancelAction

##### File System

With the file system API you can access files on Freebox
internal disk and disks connected to the Freebox.

###### Path encoding

`NOTE:`

For maximum compatibility issues path are encoded in base64, you
*should* use the path as it is returned by the ls API call.

For instance this will solve problems with [unicode equivalence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence) .

Although “Spécial” (0x53 0x70 **0xc3 0xa9** 0x63 0x69 0x61 0x6c) and
“Spécial” (0x53 0x70 **0x65 0xcc 0x81** 0x63 0x69 0x61 0x6c) are utf8
equivalent, it represents two different paths.

Some software/libraries will replace the original string with its
normalized form, causing issues.  The use of base64 encoded path will
ensure the original path will be preserved.

###### Operations

Each time you want to perform a modification on the file system you
will have to create a new FsTask that you will be
able to monitor.

NOTE: The requested operation may be en-queued to avoid performance
drop because of excessive disk io

Conflict resolution

For certain file operations where a file name conflict can happen,
you must specify a conflict resolution mode.

Valid resolution modes are:

| Conflict mode | Description |
| --- | --- |
| overwrite | Overwrite the destination file |
| both | Keep both files (rename the file adding a suffix) |
| recent | Only overwrite if newer than destination file |
| skip | Keep the destination file |

Move files

**`POST ``/api/v15/fs/mv/`**

: **Parameters**

: - **files** (*string[]*) – The list of files to move

- **dst** (*string*) – The destination

- **mode** (*enum*) – The conflict resolution mode

**Example request for moving files**:

```

##### File Upload

This API allows you to upload files to the Freebox Server.

NOTE: for large transfer files, you should prefer FTP over HTTP
transfer

*WARNING* the previous http upload method is now deprecated since api v4,
you must now use the new WebSocket upload Api. If you can’t support WebSocket,
you must use ftp for file transfer

###### File Upload Errors

When attempting to access the file upload API, you may encounter the
following errors:

| error_code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| invalid_request | Invalid request |
| path_not_found | File or folder not found |
| access_denied | Write permission denied in the destination folder |
| destination_conflict | A file with same name already exists |
| invalid_id | Invalid file upload id |
| cancelled | Someone on a side channel as cancelled the upload |
| noent | No upload with this id |

###### File Upload object

File uploads have the following attributes:

**`FileUpload`**

: **`id` int* Read-only***

: upload id

**`size` int* Read-only***

: Upload file size in bytes

**`uploaded` int* Read-only***

: Uploaded bytes

**`status` enum* Read-only***

: upload status can have the following values

| status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| authorized | Upload authorization is valid, upload has not started yet |
| in_progress | Upload in progress |
| done | Upload done |
| failed | Upload failed |
| conflict | Destination file conflict |
| timeout | Upload authorization is no longer valid |
| cancelled | Upload cancelled by user |

**`start_date` timestamp* Read-only***

: upload start date

**`last_update` timestamp* Read-only***

: last update of file upload object

**`upload_name` string* Read-only***

: name of the file uploaded

**`dirname` string* Read-only***

: upload destination directory

###### WebSocket File Upload API

The file upload WebSocket path is /api/v8/ws/upload

With this new API, the need for creating a ‘file upload authorization’
has now been removed.

To be able to upload a file to the Freebox, you must open a WebSocket
connection to the upload api, then for each file you want to upload
you must :

- send a FileUploadStartAction with the action ‘upload_start’

- wait for the associated [WebSocketResponse](index.html#WebSocketResponse) that indicates
success, then start transferring the file content by chunks,
each chunk being a binary WebSocket frame.

For each chunk you send, you’ll get a WsUploadProgress response indicating that
the associated chunk has been received and processed. Note that you should not
wait for this response before sending the next data chunk in order to get
good bandwidth performance.

- once all chunks have been transferred, you should send a
FileUploadFinalizeAction with the action ‘upload_finalize’ and wait
for the associated [WebSocketResponse](index.html#WebSocketResponse) indicating success

Note that if you have multiple files to send, you should reuse the same
WebSocket connection, and repeat the upload steps again.

If for any reason the WebSocket is closed during upload, the partially sent
file will be left as-is on the Freebox to allow resuming upload at a later point.

If you want to cancel an ongoing upload ou can send a
FileUploadCancelAction. The partially uploaded
file will then be deleted

File Upload Start Action

**`FileUploadStartAction`**

: **`request_id` int**

: optional request_id

**`action` string**

: must be ‘upload_start’

**`size` int**

: optional file size

**`dirname` string**

: the destination directory (encoded value)

**`filename` string**

: the destination filename

**`force` enum**

: select the way conflicts are handled

| Force mode | Description |
| --- | --- |
| *missing* | The response to the FileUploadStartAction will be an error with ‘destination_conflict’ if the destination file already exists. The response will also contain a file_size attribute containing the existing file length (useful for resuming upload) |
| overwrite | If the target file already exists it will be overridden |
| resume | The upload will resume, all sent chunks will then be appended to the existing file. |

File Upload Finalize action

**`FileUploadFinalizeAction`**

: **`request_id` int**

: optional request_id

**`action` string**

: must be ‘upload_finalize’

File Upload Cancel action

**`FileUploadCancelAction`**

: **`request_id` int**

: optional request_id

**`action` string**

: must be ‘upload_cancel’

File Upload Chunk

File upload chunk are just Binary WebSocket frames containing raw file
content.

File Upload Chunk Response

For each received chunk, the Freebox will send a chunk response containing
upload progress information the request_id used in response will be
the one from the FileUploadStartAction, and ‘action’ value
will be ‘upload_data’

**`FileUploadChunkResponse`**

: **`total_len` int**

: target file current length

**`complete` bool**

: will be true in a reply to FileUploadFinalizeAction
or FileUploadCancelAction

**`cancelled` bool**

: will be true in a reply FileUploadCancelAction

Get FS advices

**`GET ``/api/v8/storage/disk/{disk_id}/fsadvice?partition_id={partition_id}&dedicated_disk={bool}`**

: Check disk FS and get formatting advices.

To be able to get FS advice for a disk you need to provide the
disk_id. Specify dedicated_disk for a disk that will only be
used with the Freebox server (no need to specify it for a SATA
internal disk). If the disk is empty do not specify partition_id
in order to get advice for creating a new one. If the disk
contains a partition specify the partition_id that needs to be
checked.

Create a RAID array

**`POST ``/api/v8/storage/raid/`**

: 

**Send a RaidArray with the following members:**
: - level

- name

- members

**Each member should have the following property:**
: - id

Delete a RAID array

**`DELETE ``/api/v8/storage/raid/{id}`**

: 

Start or stop a RAID array

Send a RaidArray with properties “id” and “state”.

This is used to start and stop an array by changing the state to “stopped” or “running”. These are the only two supported operations. Any change to other fields is ignored.

**`PUT ``/api/v8/storage/raid/{id}`**

: 

Force start a RAID array

In case an array is incomplete, but has enough data to start in degraded mode, it won’t start automatically at boot, and the force start can be used. Can only be done if array state is “error”.

**`POST ``/api/v8/storage/raid/{id}/forcestart`**

: 

Remove faulty members from RAID array

In case an array has faulty members, it might be desirable to delete them to add others members instead. Can only be done if array is not running.

**`DELETE ``/api/v8/storage/raid/{id}/members/faulty`**

: 

Add members to an existing array that has missing members

In case an array is incomplete (has missing members), either because they were removed physically, or after becoming faulty, it’s possible to add new members to let the reconstruction happen. Can only be done if array is not running.

**`PUT ``/api/v8/storage/raid/{id}/members`**

: 

Send a json object containing a “members” property, which is array of RaidMember objects. Only the “id” property of each member is required.

Re-add out-of-sync members that appear as spares

In case an array has been force-started without a member, and then said member is physically plugged, it won’t be added automatically and will appear with the “spare” role, this operation must be used. Can only be done if the array has a member with the “spare” role, and is not running.

**`POST ``/api/v8/storage/raid/{id}/members/addspares`**

:

Get FS advices

**`GET ``/api/v8/storage/disk/{disk_id}/fsadvice?partition_id={partition_id}&dedicated_disk={bool}`**

: Check disk FS and get formatting advices.

To be able to get FS advice for a disk you need to provide the
disk_id. Specify dedicated_disk for a disk that will only be
used with the Freebox server (no need to specify it for a SATA
internal disk). If the disk is empty do not specify partition_id
in order to get advice for creating a new one. If the disk
contains a partition specify the partition_id that needs to be
checked.

Create a RAID array

**`POST ``/api/v8/storage/raid/`**

: 

**Send a RaidArray with the following members:**
: - level

- name

- members

**Each member should have the following property:**
: - id

Delete a RAID array

**`DELETE ``/api/v8/storage/raid/{id}`**

: 

Start or stop a RAID array

Send a RaidArray with properties “id” and “state”.

This is used to start and stop an array by changing the state to “stopped” or “running”. These are the only two supported operations. Any change to other fields is ignored.

**`PUT ``/api/v8/storage/raid/{id}`**

: 

Force start a RAID array

In case an array is incomplete, but has enough data to start in degraded mode, it won’t start automatically at boot, and the force start can be used. Can only be done if array state is “error”.

**`POST ``/api/v8/storage/raid/{id}/forcestart`**

: 

Remove faulty members from RAID array

In case an array has faulty members, it might be desirable to delete them to add others members instead. Can only be done if array is not running.

**`DELETE ``/api/v8/storage/raid/{id}/members/faulty`**

: 

Add members to an existing array that has missing members

In case an array is incomplete (has missing members), either because they were removed physically, or after becoming faulty, it’s possible to add new members to let the reconstruction happen. Can only be done if array is not running.

**`PUT ``/api/v8/storage/raid/{id}/members`**

: 

Send a json object containing a “members” property, which is array of RaidMember objects. Only the “id” property of each member is required.

Re-add out-of-sync members that appear as spares

In case an array has been force-started without a member, and then said member is physically plugged, it won’t be added automatically and will appear with the “spare” role, this operation must be used. Can only be done if the array has a member with the “spare” role, and is not running.

**`POST ``/api/v8/storage/raid/{id}/members/addspares`**

The event will contain this object:

**`VmStateChange`**

: **`id` int* Read-only***

: VM id.

**`status` enum* Read-only***

: New VM.status.

You can also watch for `lan_host_l3addr_reachable` and compare it with VM.mac to get the VM IP when it starts.
